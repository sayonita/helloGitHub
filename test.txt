#Hello! World GIT!!
~Sayonita



1. We are making a new file <- Test.txt
2. Git has many commands but we would see some basics like - commit, pull, push
3. Stash and others are important


4. When we make a new file, we need to have it to commit it
a) Locally first
b) Then we have to push it to remote server in our case your github account?



FAQ:

1. How did the text file u created der came here?
-> Open Source is smart enough to pick it

F:\GitHub\.git is keeping track of all.


2. It takes only .txt files?
Ans> It takes all files, except what we mentioned in .gitignore file.
we don't yet have a .gitignore file. so we would make one.

Now, we have made a .gitignore file and in it we have mentioned which files to
ignore.

Now lets commit files locally

3. When you make a new file, there status is Unstaged files, also when you update any old files. we would see them. 


Your turn now. Stage only .gitignore and test.txt Use stage selected :P fir se karo aap

Cool, now we have to provide a message. Write -inital commit in message box. Why because when we commit, we provide a message what we have changed in the file. 

Click on commit. Congrats!

Now if you see in Source tree, test.txt is changed.

we added few lines more which are show in + and the deleted or changed with -

 
Now Push would push it to your remote, url - https://github.com/sayonita/helloGitHub  psuh kru?
